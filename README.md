# Connect-Four
The game of connect four is a turn based game where you have an n Ã— n board, and a player places a chip at the top of the column and lets go of the chip and slides on top of other chips on that column. Each player has either red chips or blue chips, and players alternate between each other. This continues until a player wins (when there is 4 chips of the same color adjacent to each other either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
